# Demo service instance deployment documentation

## Overview

'(Service Overview Content)'.

'''
eg:

The Demo service is an example of a computing nest.
This topic describes how to activate the 'Demo' service on the computing nest, as well as the deployment process and usage instructions.
'''

## Billing Description

'(Billing description content)'

'''
eg:

Demo's expenses on computing nests mainly involve:

-Selected vCPU and memory specifications
-System disk type and capacity
-public network bandwidth

Billing methods include:

-Pay-As-You-Go (hours)
-Package year and package month

The following examples are currently provided:

| Specification family | vCPU and memory | System disk | Internet bandwidth |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ecs.r6.xlarge | Memory type r6,4vCPU 32GiB | ESSD 200GiB PL0 | Fixed bandwidth 1Mbps |

The estimated cost can be seen in real time when the instance is created.
For more specifications and other services (such as cluster high availability requirements and enterprise-level support services), please contact us at [mailto:xx@xx.com](mailto:xx@xx.com).

## Deployment Architecture

'(Deployment overview content)'

## Permissions required for RAM accounts

'(Rights Policy Contents)'

'''
eg:

The demo service needs to access and create resources such as ECS and VPC. If you use a RAM user to create a service instance, you need to add the corresponding resource permissions to the account of the RAM user before creating the service instance. For details about how to add RAM permissions, see [Authorize RAM users](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/121945.html). The required permissions are shown in the following table.


| Permission policy name | Comment |
| --- | --- |
| AliyunECSFullAccess | Permissions for managing ECS instances |

## Deployment process

### Deployment steps

'(Deployment step content)'

'''
eg:

1. Click the deployment link to enter the service instance deployment interface, and fill in the parameters according to the interface prompts to complete the deployment.
2. Supplementary schematic diagram.
'''
### Deployment parameter description

'(Deployment parameter description content)'

'''
eg:

When you create a service instance, you need to configure the service instance information. Details of the input parameters of the Cloud XR Real-Time Rendering Platform service instance are described below.

| Parameter group | Parameter item | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Service instance name | | test | Instance name |
| Region | | China (Beijing) | Select the region of the service instance. We recommend that you select the region nearby to obtain better network latency. |
'''

### Validation Results

'(Verify result content)'

'''
eg:

1. View the service instance. After the service instance is created successfully, the deployment time takes about 2 minutes. After the deployment is complete, the corresponding service instance is displayed on the page.
2. Access the TuGraph through the service instance. After entering the corresponding service instance, you can obtain the three usage modes of web, rpc, and ssh on the page.
